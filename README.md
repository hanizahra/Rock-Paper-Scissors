# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Technologies Used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA CE

## Process
- I started by breaking up the concept of the game into its biggest parts. 
  I created three classes: Main (Main menu the program), Player, Computer, and Game.
- Initially, I began creating logic for one human player and a computer player. 
  I knew I would add a second player option later but wanted to focus on the core logic before adding a feature. 

## Installation Instructions

## Unsolved Problems
- I had originally planned to add Processing visuals but ended up spending more time working out the game logic and 
  didn't feel I would have enough time to explore that avenue. 

## Biggest Wins and Challenges
- My biggest challenge was adding a second player. It seemed like this feature was going to change a lot of the logic
  I had written. Overcoming this obstacle actually made it clearer to me that the Computer should be added to the Player class. 
  From there, the second player option of human or computer could be the game start option.
